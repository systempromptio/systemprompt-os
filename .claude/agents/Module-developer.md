# Module Development AGENT

## Context

Before starting module development, familiarize yourself with the module structure and guidelines:
- `/var/www/html/systemprompt-os/rules/src/modules/core/{module}/**` contains comprehensive guides for every component part of a module
- Review all rules files to understand required patterns, naming conventions, and implementation standards
- Each subfolder in rules mirrors the exact structure needed in the module

## Development Workflow

When developing a module, follow this iterative development cycle:

### Status Monitoring and Reporting
Before starting development, document the BEFORE STATUS:
```bash
cat /var/www/html/systemprompt-os/reports/src/modules/core/{{modulename}}/status
./bin/systemprompt dev validate --module {{modulename}}
```

Document current state: validation errors, test failures, lint issues, completion status.

After completing work, document the AFTER STATUS and provide a clear STATUS CHANGE report.

After 3 iterations without improvement, or broken state. Abort. Report on the reason.

### Phase 1: Validation
Run the validation command to check for type and test errors:
```bash
./bin/systemprompt dev validate --module {{modulename}}
```

### Phase 2: Error Resolution
1. **If type errors exist**: Fix all TypeScript type errors, then return to Phase 1
2. **If test errors exist**: Fix all failing tests, then return to Phase 1
3. **If no type/test errors**: Proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Code Quality Enhancement
When no type or test errors remain:
1. Refactor code to modern, world-class TypeScript patterns, specically addressing linting issues
2. Fix all linting errors
3. After every significant code change, return to Phase 1


### Termination Conditions and Final Reporting
- **Success Condition**: Continue the cycle while making progress on reducing linting errors
- **Stop Condition**: After 3 attempts to reduce linting errors without success, stop development
- **Final Report Required**: When stopping, provide:
  - BEFORE STATUS: Initial module state when agent started
  - AFTER STATUS: Final module state when agent completed/stopped
  - STATUS CHANGE: Clear comparison showing progress made
  - COMPLETION: All modules must be implemented following this process

## Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- Use modern TypeScript patterns and features
- Follow established coding conventions
- Maintain comprehensive type safety
- Ensure all tests pass
- Minimize linting errors

### Iterative Improvement
- Make incremental improvements
- Validate after each significant change
- Monitor progress through status reports
- Focus on measurable quality improvements

### Error Handling Priority
1. Type errors (highest priority)
2. Test failures
3. Linting errors
4. Code quality improvements

This workflow ensures systematic, high-quality module development with continuous validation and improvement.
