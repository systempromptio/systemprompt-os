# Testing Agent for Module Coverage

## Context

Before starting test development and execution, familiarize yourself with the testing structure and guidelines:
- `/var/www/html/systemprompt-os/rules/src/modules/core/{module}/**` contains comprehensive guides for testing requirements
- Review testing rules files to understand coverage standards, test patterns, and reporting requirements
- Each module should have both unit tests and integration tests with comprehensive coverage

## Development Workflow

When working on module testing, follow this iterative testing cycle:

### Status Monitoring and Reporting
Before starting testing, document the BEFORE STATUS:
```bash
./bin/systemprompt dev test --module {{modulename}} --coverage
```

Document current state: test count, passing/failing tests, coverage percentages, missing test files.

After completing work, document the AFTER STATUS and provide a clear STATUS CHANGE report.

After 3 iterations without improvement, or broken test state. Abort. Report on the reason with before/after comparison.

### Phase 1: Test Discovery and Coverage Analysis
Run the test suite with coverage reporting:
```bash
./bin/systemprompt dev test --module {{modulename}} --coverage
```

### Phase 2: Test Resolution
1. **If test failures exist**: Fix all failing tests, then return to Phase 1
2. **If coverage is below 90%**: Add missing tests to improve coverage, then return to Phase 1
3. **If no test failures and coverage >= 90%**: Proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Test Quality Enhancement
When all tests pass and coverage is adequate:
1. Refactor tests to modern, comprehensive patterns
2. Add edge case testing
3. Improve test documentation and clarity
4. After every significant test change, return to Phase 1

### Termination Conditions and Final Reporting
- **Success Condition**: Continue the cycle while making progress on test coverage and quality
- **Stop Condition**: After 3 attempts without improving test coverage or fixing failures, stop testing
- **Final Report Required**: When stopping, provide:
  - BEFORE STATUS: Initial test state and coverage when agent started
  - AFTER STATUS: Final test state and coverage when agent completed/stopped
  - STATUS CHANGE: Clear comparison showing test improvements made
- **Completion**: All modules must achieve 90%+ coverage with all tests passing

## Best Practices

### Test Quality Standards
- Achieve minimum 90% code coverage
- All tests must pass without errors or warnings
- Use modern testing patterns and mocking strategies
- Maintain comprehensive test documentation
- Cover both happy path and error scenarios

### Test Coverage Priority
1. Core service methods (highest priority)
2. Database operations and repositories
3. CLI command functionality
4. Error handling and edge cases
5. Integration scenarios

### Iterative Improvement
- Run tests after each significant change
- Monitor coverage improvements through iterations
- Focus on quality over quantity of tests
- Ensure tests are maintainable and clear

### Testing Standards
1. Unit tests (highest priority)
2. Integration tests
3. CLI command tests
4. Error scenario coverage

This workflow ensures systematic, high-quality test development with continuous coverage improvement and validation.
