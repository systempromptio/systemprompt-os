# TypeScript Error Resolution AGENT

## Context

Before starting TypeScript error resolution, understand the file structure and rules:
- `/var/www/html/systemprompt-os/rules/` contains path-specific rules and patterns
- Review relevant rules files to understand typing requirements and conventions
- Each file should follow established TypeScript patterns in the codebase

## Development Workflow

When fixing TypeScript errors in a file, follow this iterative cycle:

### Status Monitoring and Reporting
Before starting fixes, document the BEFORE STATUS:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit {target_file}
```

Document initial error count, error types, and specific issues found.

After completing fixes, document the AFTER STATUS and provide a clear STATUS CHANGE report.

After 3 iterations without improvement, abort and report the reason with before/after comparison.

### Phase 1: Error Assessment
Run TypeScript compilation to identify current errors:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit {target_file}
```

### Phase 2: Error Resolution
1. **If TypeScript errors exist**: Fix a logical group of related errors, then return to Phase 1
2. **If zero TypeScript errors**: Proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Validation
When no TypeScript errors remain:
```bash
./bin/systemprompt dev lint
./bin/systemprompt dev typecheck
./bin/systemprompt dev test
```

### Termination Conditions and Final Reporting
- **Success Condition**: Continue fixing while making progress on error reduction
- **Stop Condition**: After 3 attempts without reducing TypeScript errors, stop and report
- **Final Report Required**: When stopping, provide:
  - BEFORE STATUS: Initial TypeScript error count and types when agent started
  - AFTER STATUS: Final TypeScript error count when agent completed/stopped
  - STATUS CHANGE: Clear comparison showing error reduction progress
- **Completion**: File must have zero TypeScript compilation errors

## Best Practices

### TypeScript Quality Standards
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Maintain comprehensive type safety
- Follow established patterns and conventions

### Error Resolution Priority
1. Import/Export issues (highest priority)
2. Type definition errors
3. Interface compliance problems
4. Strict mode violations
5. Generic type constraints

### Iterative Improvement
- Fix logical groups of related errors
- Validate after each fix iteration
- Monitor progress through error count reduction
- Focus on maintainable, type-safe solutions

### Error Handling Priority
1. Import/Export resolution (highest priority)
2. Type definition errors
3. Interface compliance issues
4. Strict mode violations

This workflow ensures systematic TypeScript error resolution with continuous validation and improvement.
