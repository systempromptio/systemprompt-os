# OAuth Tunnel Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

We successfully implemented automatic Cloudflare tunnel support for OAuth authentication in SystemPrompt OS. This solves the localhost restriction issues with Google and GitHub OAuth providers.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Auth Module Enhancements**

- Added `TunnelService` class to manage Cloudflare tunnels
- Integrated tunnel creation into auth module startup
- Automatic detection of OAuth provider configuration
- Dynamic updating of OAuth redirect URIs with tunnel URL

### 2. **Docker Configuration**

- Added cloudflared CLI to Docker image
- Automatic installation during container build
- No additional setup required by users

### 3. **Configuration Options**

```bash
# Option 1: Automatic temporary tunnel (Development)
ENABLE_OAUTH_TUNNEL=true

# Option 2: Permanent domain (Production)
OAUTH_DOMAIN=https://oauth.yourdomain.com

# Option 3: Cloudflare tunnel with token
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=your-tunnel-token
```

### 4. **Provider Registry Updates**

- Providers are initialized after tunnel is established
- Environment variables are dynamically updated with tunnel URL
- Supports runtime reloading of provider configurations

## How It Works

1. **Startup Sequence**:
   - Auth module initializes
   - Checks for OAuth provider configuration
   - If providers exist and `ENABLE_OAUTH_TUNNEL=true`, starts tunnel
   - Waits for tunnel URL from cloudflared
   - Updates BASE_URL and OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI environment variables
   - Initializes OAuth providers with tunnel URL

2. **Tunnel URL Extraction**:
   - Monitors cloudflared stderr output
   - Uses regex to extract tunnel URL: `/https:\/\/[a-z0-9-]+\.trycloudflare\.com/`
   - Emits events when tunnel is ready

3. **Provider Configuration**:
   - YAML files use environment variable substitution
   - `${OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI}` is dynamically replaced with tunnel URL
   - Providers see the public URL instead of localhost

## Usage Example

1. Set up OAuth credentials:
```bash
# .env
ENABLE_OAUTH_TUNNEL=true
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Check logs for tunnel URL:
```bash
docker logs systemprompt-coding-agent-mcp-server-1 | grep "Tunnel established"
```

Output:
```
üöá Tunnel established: https://example-tunnel.trycloudflare.com
üìç Public URL: https://example-tunnel.trycloudflare.com
üîó OAuth Redirect Base: https://example-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/oauth2/callback
```

4. Configure OAuth providers with the tunnel URLs shown in logs

## Testing

Run the OAuth test with automatic tunnel support:
```bash
npm run test:oauth
```

The test will automatically use the tunnel URL for OAuth flows.

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with just `ENABLE_OAUTH_TUNNEL=true`
2. **Automatic Detection**: Only creates tunnel when OAuth providers are configured
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to localhost if tunnel fails
4. **Production Ready**: Supports permanent domains for production use
5. **Secure**: Tunnels are temporary and random, reducing security risks

## Security Considerations

- Temporary tunnels are public URLs - anyone with the URL can access
- URLs change on each restart, preventing long-term exposure
- For production, use permanent domains with proper SSL certificates
- Tunnel tokens should be kept secure and not committed to version control

## Next Steps

To use this feature:

1. Ensure Docker is rebuilt with the latest changes
2. Set `ENABLE_OAUTH_TUNNEL=true` in your `.env` file
3. Add your OAuth provider credentials
4. Start the application and check logs for the tunnel URL
5. Configure your OAuth providers with the provided URLs

The tunnel will automatically start whenever OAuth providers are configured and no permanent domain is set.
