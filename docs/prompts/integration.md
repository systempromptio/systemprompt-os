  ðŸ“‹ Strategic Plan to Reach 80% Coverage

  Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests (Immediate)

  1. Fix Logger Initialization Issues - Update failing tests to use proper initialization patterns
  2. Validate All 177 Tests Run Successfully - Get from 42 passing to 177 passing
  3. Measure Baseline Coverage - Run coverage analysis with all tests working

  Phase 2: Add Critical Module Tests (High Impact)

  1. Webhooks Integration Tests - API endpoints, delivery mechanisms, failure handling
  2. Permissions Integration Tests - Access control, role validation, security boundaries
  3. Users Integration Tests - User lifecycle, authentication flows, profile management
  4. Monitor Integration Tests - Health checks, metrics collection, alerting

  Phase 3: Expand Existing Coverage (Targeted)

  1. Enhanced Logger Tests - Advanced logging scenarios, error handling, performance
  2. Extended Config Tests - Complex configuration scenarios, validation, migration
  3. Comprehensive CLI Tests - All command combinations, error scenarios, edge cases

  Coverage Projection:

  - Current: ~23.7% (42/177 tests passing)
  - Phase 1: ~65-70% (all 177 tests passing + fixes)
  - Phase 2: ~75-80% (+ 4 critical module test suites)
  - Phase 3: ~80-85% (+ enhanced existing coverage)
