 Think carefully, ignore migartion stategy, system is still in production. Implement the MCP module           │
│   according the plan. We should have add, edit and delete MCP contexts which will fully saved SERVER objects   │
│   to be rendered in the frontend. There should be a tools, prompts and resources services, these should        │
│   persist fully compatible MCP SDK tools, prompts and resources to the database, and be accessible by the      │
│   servers using the SDK commands. The outcome should be a module where we manage fully compliant MCP servers.  │
│   Also ensure that tools include permissions configuratino, and severs include authentication requirements     │
│   (also handled by MCP SDK). Ensure you are familiar with the events and permissions modules IF integration    │
│   with other modules is required. Refine the plan, and then exectute so that we server an MCP server using     │
│   the configration saved and managed by our module
