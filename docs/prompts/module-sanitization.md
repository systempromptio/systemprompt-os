check the tasks module, ALL types must be autogenerated from the scdhema, which is created using npm run typecheck. All services MUST be imported from the service folder, do not define any SERVICES in the index, the index should be the singleton class and standardized methods only, exported a typed and guarded interface Types MUST be autogenerated and conversions HIGHLY justified, think deeply. Never 'reexport' types, use autogenerated types directly. anything that is in the database should have an autogenerated type, analyse the types file in detail? Does this comply? We shouldn't save JSON in DB unless highly justified, prefer structured save in database. Make sure no type errors remain in this module.
