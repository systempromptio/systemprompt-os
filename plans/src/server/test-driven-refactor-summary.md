# Test-Driven Server Refactoring Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Analysis Phase ✅
- Reviewed server architecture rules (`rules.md`)
- Analyzed refactoring plan (`refactor.md`)
- Studied module integration patterns (`integration.md`)
- Identified all critical issues in current implementation

### 2. Planning Phase ✅
- Created comprehensive implementation plan
- Defined 5-week accelerated timeline
- Established test-driven approach
- Created `/plans/src/server/event-driven-architecture.plan.md`

### 3. Integration Tests Written ✅

#### Core Server Tests (`/tests/integration/server/core/server-core.integration.test.ts`)
- Server lifecycle management
- Event bus functionality
- Protocol registration
- Service registry
- Health checks
- Graceful shutdown

#### HTTP Protocol Tests (`/tests/integration/server/protocols/http-protocol.integration.test.ts`)
- Dynamic endpoint registration
- Request/response via events
- Authentication integration
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- CORS handling

#### MCP Protocol Tests (`/tests/integration/server/protocols/mcp-protocol.integration.test.ts`)
- Multi-context support
- Tool registration and execution
- Resource management
- Session handling
- Authentication

#### Module Bridge Tests (`/tests/integration/server/integration/module-bridge.integration.test.ts`)
- Dynamic endpoint registration
- Request routing to modules
- Cross-module communication
- Middleware support
- Performance metrics

#### Authentication Tests (`/tests/integration/server/auth/auth-integration.test.ts`)
- Token validation via events
- Session management
- OAuth flow integration
- Role-based access control
- Custom auth strategies

## Next Steps: Refactoring Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Server Foundation
1. Create `/src/server/core/` directory structure
2. Implement `ServerCore` class with:
   - Event-driven architecture
   - No direct module imports
   - Protocol-agnostic design
   - Service registry
   - Event bus service

3. Key files to create:
   ```
   src/server/core/
   ├── server.ts
   ├── types/
   │   ├── server.types.ts
   │   └── events.types.ts
   └── services/
       ├── event-bus.service.ts
       └── registry.service.ts
   ```

### Phase 2: Protocol Handlers
1. Create protocol abstraction layer
2. Implement HTTP protocol handler
3. Implement MCP protocol handler with multi-context
4. Remove protocol logic from main server

### Phase 3: Module Integration
1. Build module bridge service
2. Create endpoint registry
3. Implement request forwarding via events
4. Remove all direct module imports

### Phase 4: Auth Migration
1. Remove `ServerAuthAdapter`
2. Implement auth via events only
3. Update all auth middleware
4. Test OAuth flows

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. Remove old server code
2. Delete deprecated files
3. Update documentation
4. Performance optimization

## Running the Tests

The integration tests are designed to fail initially and drive the implementation:

```bash
# Run all server integration tests
npm test tests/integration/server/

# Run specific test suite
npm test tests/integration/server/core/server-core.integration.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch tests/integration/server/
```

## Key Implementation Guidelines

1. **No Direct Module Imports**: The server must never import modules directly
2. **Event-Driven**: All communication via event bus
3. **Dynamic Registration**: Endpoints registered at runtime
4. **Protocol Agnostic**: Core server doesn't know about HTTP/MCP
5. **Testable**: Each component independently testable

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Zero direct module imports in server
- [ ] 100% dynamic endpoint registration
- [ ] <100ms startup time
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] All TypeScript strict checks pass

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Modules can be added/removed without server changes
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new protocols
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Performance**: Event-driven architecture enables better resource usage

## Current Blockers

The main blocker is that the current implementation has:
- Direct module imports throughout
- Hardcoded routes
- Mixed responsibilities
- No event bus infrastructure

These all need to be refactored incrementally, using the tests to ensure nothing breaks.

## Estimated Timeline

- Week 1: Core server foundation
- Week 2: Protocol abstraction
- Week 3: Module integration bridge
- Week 4: Authentication migration
- Week 5: Testing and cleanup

Total: **5 weeks** for complete refactoring
